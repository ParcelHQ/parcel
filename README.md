## Motivation 
Centralized payments service providers like Stripe and Braintree charge high transaction fees and store data in a centralized database prone to hacks and attacks hence compromising user's data privacy.
Moreover, there is no provision for financial settlements as a function of time.

Decentralized streaming protocol Sablier enables financial settlements as a function of time which opens up a lot of use cases that were neven possible in a centralized system.

However, the current scenario in decentralised payment streaming services lack the ability to conveniently manage custom use cases resulting in a slow rate of adoption. We believe the space needs a seamless, secure, decentralized, and end-to-end encrypted payment streaming service.
