## Motivation 
Centralised payments service providers like stripe and braintree charge high transaction fees and stores data in a centralised database prone to hacks and attacks hence compromising user's data privacy.
Moreover, there is no provision for financial settlements as a function of time.

Decentralised streaming protocol Sablier enables financial settlements as a function of time which opens up a lot of use cases that were neven possible in a centralised system.

However, the current scenario in decentralised payment streaming services lack the ability to conveniently manage custom use cases resulting in slow rate of adoption. We believe the space needs a seamless, secure, decentralised and end to end encrypted payment streaming service.
